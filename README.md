# **Robustifying Marginal Linear Models for Correlated Responses Using a Constructive Multivariate Huber Distribution**

## **Overview**
We present a novel approach to analyzing correlated data through a robust marginal model incorporating a multivariate Huber distribution. This model provides robustness against outliers and features a **tuning parameter** to control the degree of robustness, where larger values approximate normality and smaller values enhance robustness. 

Unlike prior models with constant tuning parameters (often fixed near 2), our approach allows **subject-specific tuning parameters**, enabling analysts to adjust the influence of individual subjects based on their observations. Parameters are estimated using the exact likelihood function via the **Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)** algorithm implemented in Stan. 

Additionally, the **modified Cholesky decomposition** is employed to construct the multivariate density function, transforming constrained dispersion matrix parameters into two vectors of unconstrained parameters for easier interpretation and estimation. The model supports **flexible covariance structures**, including compound symmetry, autoregressive, and random coefficients.
